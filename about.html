    <p>
      The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small
      team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become the best.
      Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each with
      different strengths. ... With experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining
      new abilities.

    <p class="large center">
      Pokémon is a game that’s simple to get into but fearsomely difficult to
      master, both on consoles and the trading cards. Through changing worlds
      and the introduction of hundreds of new characters one thing has stayed
      the same: the overall format. It’s sort of like riding a bike in that it
      never leaves you. If you knew about Pokémon in the 90s then chances are
      you’ll know a lot more about it now than you realise – you don’t forget
      that water Pokémon are strong against fire types and so on.
