    <br />

    <p>Pokémon is short for “Pocket Monsters", the original Japanese name.</p>

    <p>
      26 February 1996 marks the debut of the Pokémon franchise in the form of
      both those games on the Game Boy in Japan. At its heart, Pocket Monsters:
      Red and Green was a very basic Japanese role-playing game. You play as a
      Pokémon trainer travelling the world and collecting the ubiquitous little
      monsters (inspired by Tajiri’s childhood love for insect collection) and
      training them in battles with other Pokémon.
    </p>

    <p>
      You start out with a single Pokémon (you get to pick one of three) and one
      aim is to “Catch ‘em all". To get all 151 Pokémon, however, you had to
      trade with other players.
